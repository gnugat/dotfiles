# ✌️ vim - Vi IMproved, this programmer's text editor

Installs neat plugins, thanks to vim-plug:

- `NERDtree`, for filesystem navigation
- `ctrlp`, for Fuzzy Finding. Can't live without a Fuzzy Finder!
- `supertab` and `phpcomplete`, for autocompletion

Also, configured to add syntax highlighting to code snippets in markdown files. Bonkers!
