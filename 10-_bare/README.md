# ğŸ§¸ Bare (minimum)

The 1x-bare tag is used for the strict minimum, ideal for ssh servers
or Docker Containers.

There are a couple of special "packages" defined here:

* `11-shell` is used to configure ALL shells (bash, zsh) in a generic manner
* `13-curl` is just here to explicitly specify that curl is required
