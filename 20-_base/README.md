# ðŸ§± Base minimal (common set up)

The 2x-base tag is used for the common set up accross platforms,
but in a minimalistic way.

These are the tools I've been using as part of my 2014 - 2024 workflow:

- **bash**: as my SHELL
- **less**: as my PAGER
- **git**: for versioning
- **PHP**: for programming
- **vim**: for editing `code`
- **tree**: instead of `ls`
- **ack**: instead of `grep`


According to my bash history file, my most used commands are:

1. bash
2. less
3. vim
4. tree
5. ack
6. fg
7. cd

In no particular order, by the way.

For 2025 - 2035, I plan on increasing my productivity 10x,
so I'm planning to replace all of those from the list.

Watch out for the `30-bang` tag!
