# ☕ Catpuccin

Soothing pastel theme for the high-spirited!

Catppuccin consists of 4 beautiful pastel color palettes, named flavors.
The theme comes in one light and three dark variants:

- Latte: Our lightest theme harmoniously inverting the essence of Catppuccin's dark themes
- Frappé: A less vibrant alternative using subdued colors for a muted aesthetic
- Macchiato: Medium contrast with gentle colors creating a soothing atmosphere
- Mocha: The Original — Our darkest variant offering a cozy feeling with color-rich accents

> _Note_: the `34-catpuccin` SSDF package does **nothing**,
> this is more of a placeholder to give information on the theme used.
